# TweetsAboutTraffic
Using the twitter api to gather tweets about traffic in Albany, NY

Tweets are first collected, then they are processed.  Then they are manually labeled from d and m to d adjusted and m adjusted.  The metrics of data collection can then be calculated.  After the tweets have been labeled, an svm or logistic regression model can be trained to identify whether a tweet is about traffic or not.
